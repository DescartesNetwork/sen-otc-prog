# OTC

## !IMPORTANT

In this program, we will use strict conventions that

- `a` is the amount of token `A` that the MAKER wants to sell.
- `b` is the amount of token `B` that the MAKER wants to buy.
- `x` is the amount of token `A` that a TAKER takes out of the treasury.
- `y` is the amount of token `B` that a TAKER puts in of the treasury.
- `maker_fee` is always about the token `B`.
- `taker_fee` is always about the token `A`.
